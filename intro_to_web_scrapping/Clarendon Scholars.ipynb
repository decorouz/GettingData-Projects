    "# 1. Why Clarendon Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "After few years of graduation from undergraduates studies, I have continually searched for scholarships and funding opportunities to further my studies. Never heard of this particular one. It was posted on linkedin by a third party connect on Linkedin. It piqued my curiosity. I did some digging on their website, found some helpful information and  the list of previous scholars. I became even more curious to learn the number of Nigerias or Africans that have enjoyed the scholarship since it began. A good opportunity to apply my programming skills to find answers to all my curiosity. Thus the need for this project. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Clarendon not only offers over 150 new, fully-funded scholarships each year to assist outstanding graduate scholars, but offers the opportunity to join one of the most active, highly international, and multidisciplinary communities at Oxford.\n",
    "\n",
    "Originally established to support Overseas students, the Clarendon Fund first welcomed scholars to Oxford in 2001. The scheme was expanded in 2012 to include students from the UK and EU, therefore providing funding for all fee statuses. Throughout this period, the Fundâ€™s aim has remained unchanged; to assist academically outstanding graduate students through their studies at the University of Oxford."
